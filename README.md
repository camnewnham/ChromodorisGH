### Purpose ###

This library is intended for use with Grasshopper, an extension to the 3D software Rhinoceros 3D. The goal of this library is to provide efficient and simple functionality to extend the creation, usage and display of meshes. 

There are multiple available, in-depth and powerful solutions for some of what is covered by this library. This is not intended as a replacement, but rather a simple, efficient, and functional alternative particularly for use in dealing with large quantities of data and geometry.

The majority of code in this library is optimized and multithreaded. For example; the voxel sampling algorithm uses a multi-threaded KD-Tree, and also switches compute modes based on historical performance (between sampling per-voxel, or inverse sampling from points).

### Grasshopper usage ###

* As a traditional grasshopper library
* As a code library to be referenced within Grasshopper
* As a hybrid; to be used in Grasshopper, with some modules written as ad-hoc C# components.

## Components ##
---
### Creation ###
* **Mesh Loft**: Creates a welded mesh from lofting polylines that have the same number of control points.
* **Mesh Pipe:** Quickly pipes polylines. Intended to be similar to "!_ApplyCurvePiping"

### Display ###
* **Curvature Approximation:** Displays approximate curvature on an immediate-vertex basis only.
* **Draft Angle Analysis:** Displays draft angles relative to the world plane.

### Isosurfacing ###
* **Sample Voxels:** Automatically creates a bounding box and grid resolution based on numerical input, and generates a grid of voxel values.
* **Sample Voxels (Custom):** As above, but allows a custom box and resolution.
* **Build Isosurface:** Constructs the isosurface based on the above found values. Can use any sampling by taking in a Single[x,y,z] as the input.
* **Close Voxel Data:** Caps the voxel values so that the output volume is ensured to be closed.


### Smoothing ###
* **QuickSmooth:** A very fast smoothing algorithm based on laplacian smoothing. Multi-threaded and optimized.
